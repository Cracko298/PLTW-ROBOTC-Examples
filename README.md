# PLTW-ROBOTC-Examples
Just a few examples of ROBOTC. Made for the "VEX-Cortex 2.0" and written in the "Natural Language PLTW" language.

*Note:* I made these codes in the Natural Language 2.0 originally and just coverted them as closely as I could to the original. Stuff is possibly broken, but thats what you should be learning to do in POE at the moment. Finding broken code, and fixing it.

Everybody has different hardware. So tweek the code here to your hardware's value sheet and you should be set.
